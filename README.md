# Simon Says Game

## App Description and Purpose

Simon Says is a modern web-based implementation of the classic memory game that challenges players to remember and replicate sequences of colors and sounds. The application is designed to test and improve memory retention, concentration, and pattern recognition skills through progressively challenging gameplay.

Built with React and TypeScript, this interactive game provides an engaging user experience with visual feedback, audio cues, and comprehensive performance tracking. Players must watch and memorize sequences of colored buttons that light up, then reproduce the exact sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
